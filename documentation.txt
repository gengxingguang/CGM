This model is just for detect gluclose level, basic task is to detect glucose level ,then 
save this glucose level to the database ,and then compare their vlaue,if glucose level is normal we do nothing cause we have
saved the glucose level to the database,but  if glucose level if too high
or too low, we send the alarm message with glucose level to the pool of patient to notice patient that the dangerous
glucoselevel, then patient will calibrate this alarm by using GM。

I just seperate this part task1 (actually CGM have two task:1:detect glucose level and 2:retrieve glucose level
)  from the "finalmodel", for simplicity and more clearly to demonstrare when presentation or making vedio, but in the report we need to include this part.


The code for this part is complete（but you may cont see the token move,but it whole process can work you could have a look about history） ,
 you could check that and write it to the report.
